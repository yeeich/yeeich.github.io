        Hi my name is Josh, I'm a Software Engineer Jr and a self-taught
        Computer Science student. I was born in Mexico City and I currently live
        with my parents and my dog Samurai, a 3-year old Boxer.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm 25 years old, and in my spare time I like to read, play and/or watch
        soccer, workout, hangout with my friends, watch tv shows and movies, and
        spend time walking and training my dog.
      </p>
      <p>
        My interests consist of programming, personal finance, mental health and
        calisthenics. I think that pursuing your dreams is crucial for being in
        peace with yourself, and my dream is to become a cybersecurity and
        privacy researcher some day.
      </p>
      <p>
        I studied Computer Engineering at Universidad Nacional Autónoma de
        México between 2014 and 2019. I used to play professional soccer in
        Mexico's low-level divisions like 2nd and 3rd Division and some 1st
        Division reserve teams like Chivas, Pumas and Cruz Azul. When I got into
        University I stopped playing professional and started playing amateur
        types of soccer, such as indoor soccer, futsal and 7v7 soccer
        representing UNAM in national competitions and university leagues.
