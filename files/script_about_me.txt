"He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life." - Muhammad Ali

Hi my name is Josh, I'm a Software Engineer Jr and a self-taught Computer Science student. I was born in Mexico City and I currently live with my parents and my dog Samurai, a 3-year old Boxer. I'm 25 years old, and in my spare time I like to read, play and/or watch soccer, workout, hangout with my friends and girlfriend, watch tv shows and movies, and spend time with my dog.

My interests consist of programming, personal finance, mental health and calisthenics. I think that pursuing your dreams is crucial for being in peace with yourself, and my dream is to become into a cybersecurity and privacy researcher some day.

I studied Computer Engineering at Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México between 2014 and 2019. I used to play professional soccer in Mexico's low-level divisions like 3rd Division and some 1st Division reserve teams like Chivas, Pumas and Cruz Azul. When I got into University I stopped playing professional and started playing other types of soccer, such as indoor soccer, futsal and 7v7 soccer representing UNAM in national competitions and university leagues.

If you are interested in viewing my work you can see the projects I have worked in or you can also check my resume.
